## TEST REACT APP

Features so far:
REACT with REFLUX actions & stores (es5) using BOOTSTRAP styling
Utilizing ATOMIC principles for structure as best as can be done
Using REACT-ROUTER and Breadcrumbs using svenanders' REACT-BREADCRUMBS
Saving mock user data to another server (writing JSON files) with image uploads saving to src server using MULTER and REACT-DROPZONE-COMPONENT
Pagination

ToDo:
Transform into ES6
More work on SCSS styling
More work on tooling using GULP
Learn transform with WEBPACK flow
Remove unused files

WELCOME: Any input or suggestions from any developers on better practices or alternative approaches to doing this. I'm still a newbie!!!
